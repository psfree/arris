; An example configuration file for use with the non volatile memory scheme
; in Envoy 9.0
;
; There are several sections to the file, the preamble contains information
; about the whole file (currently this is the version stamp).
; Each other block contains information about the named
; section of the database.  Logically each block is composed of a series
; of entries with each entry starting with an identifer and ending with
; the identifer for the next entry or the beginning of the next block.
; The order of fields within an entry doesn't matter.  Fields that
; aren't included are set to the default value as sepcified by its mib
;
; The current list of blocks is:
; RFC1445 view table: 1445view
; RFC2275 view table: 2275view
; usec code (experimental) : myagent, agent, access, context, user
; v3 code  : v3myengine, v3engines, v3user, v3group, v3access,
;            v3targetaddr, v3targetparams, v3notify, v3notifyprofile,
;            v3notifyfilter
;
; Comments are allowed anywhere however if the file is rewritten (which
; the nv code will do if allowed) comments that appear in a block after
; a field descriptior will be removed.  Symbolic names are not allowed (yet).
